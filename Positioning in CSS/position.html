        <h2 class="main-heading">Introduction to Position in CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding
          normal document flow. What if you want to slightly alter the position
          of some boxes from their default flow position to give a slightly
          quirky, distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want
          to create a UI element that floats over the top of other parts of the
          page and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no
          matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout
          work possible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heads">Static Position</h3>
        <p>Static positioning is the default that every element gets</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heads">Relative Position</h3>
        <p>
          Relative positioning is the first position type we'll take a look at.
          This is very similar to static positioning, except that once the
          positioned element has taken its place in the normal flow, you can
          then modify its final position, including making it overlap other
          elements on the page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heads">Absolute Position</h3>
        <p>
          An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal
          document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from
          everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create
          isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other
          elements on the page.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heads">Fixed Position</h3>
        <p>
          The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is
          created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned
          relative to its initial containing block, which is the viewport in the
          case of visual media. Its final position is determined by the values
          of top, right, bottom, and left.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heads">Sticky Position</h3>
        <p>
          A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position
          value is sticky. It's treated as relatively positioned until its
          containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top to
          value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it
          scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" until meeting
          the opposite edge of its containing block.
